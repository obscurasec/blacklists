## 🐞🎣 Malware and Phishing Blacklist
This compilation includes thousands of websites. It serves as a supplementary blacklist aimed at enhancing internet users' protection, with a focus on safeguarding users in Brazil 🇧🇷. However, it also encompasses websites from other countries. We gather samples through real-world interactions, mimicking the potential exposures that everyday users might encounter in their daily online activities.
