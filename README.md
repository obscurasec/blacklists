### 🐞🎣 Malware and Phishing Blacklist
This compilation includes thousands of websites identified as malware, phishing/scams, fraudulent retailers, or suspicious pages. It serves as a supplementary blacklist aimed at enhancing internet users' protection, with a focus on safeguarding users in Brazil 🇧🇷. However, it also encompasses websites from other countries. We gather samples through real-world interactions, mimicking the potential exposures that everyday users might encounter in their daily online activities.

The blacklist is available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obscurasec/blacklists/main/malware.phishing.blacklist) :)
